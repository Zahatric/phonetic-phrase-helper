## About

Phonetic phrase helper is a mini-JS app (and library) that allows you to enter a password or phrase and have the phonic from the NATO phonetic alphabet printed out alongside each character. This allows you to easily give out a password or spell words over the phone whilst learning the phonetic alphabet at the same time.

## Quick start

 * Visit http://dansimau.github.com/phonetic-phrase-helper/ and type in your password
 * Include phonetics.js into your project

## Note about security

The app and conversion is done entirely in client-side JavaScript (from a browser) so your password is never sent to the server. If you like, you can <a href="https://github.com/dansimau/phonetic-phrase-helper">examine the source code</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dansimau/phonetic-phrase-helper/zipball/gh-pages">download</a> the app to your computer and run it locally.
